 Predictor is ON by default for structural elements with rotational      
 degrees of freedom.  Use the PRED,OFF command to turn the predictor     
 OFF if it adversely affects the convergence.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.
